## Synopsis

Looking for an easy way to find out how many bells you made (or lost) in the Animal Crossing Stalk Market? Look no further! Just punch in:

How much you bought the turnips from Joan for (each),
How many you bought,
How much you sold them for,

and this will do the rest.

## Installation

The easiest way at the moment is to right click on "calculator.html" and click Save Link As... then run it from your system. I hope to have this on a GitHub Pages soon so you can go to a link and run it there.

## Contributors

@aec1130 wrote the original code, I just prettied it up and added a few more calculations to it.

## The basic code flow

User input
x = cost of turnips each ( range 90 - 110 )
y = how many you bought
z = how much you sold them for

Output
a = total cost of turnips
b = gross profit
c = calculate a 10% tip and subtract it from gross

Calculations
a = x * y
b = z * y
c = 10% of b

_This has since been changed in the actual program so it no longer gets a 10% tip from your gross._
